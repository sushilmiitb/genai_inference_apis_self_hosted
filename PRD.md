# Title
Gen AI Inference APIs Self Hosted

# Description
We will be using this project to expose inference APIs for front-end usage. The main purpose is to host opensource models so that the client doesn't have to pay for calling APIs hosted by GenAI companies.


# Feature - expose huggingface APIs to allow clients to get embeddings
* Download and host huggingface so that we can run the models of choice
* Expose APIs to allow users to quary embeddings of a particular text
* Write tests to test the functionality
